# My First Readme!

## This is my first Readme and in the following you will find:

* Refactored starter code

* Correct Semantic HTML

* Explanation of what the code is displaying

1. ## During the rafactoring of this code, I added all the Alt attributes that were missing from the original code. This is important because if the img tag does not show up on a webpage then it will at least give a desccription of what should be showing. 

2. ## I also corrected the incorrect semantic HTML elements and the reason we do this is to make the wepage accessible for people who may have specific issues looking at webpages. For example: the headers, sections, and navigation parts of the webpage are are to be identified. 

# Now this code is actually displaying an ad website for a company that specializes in specific web capabilites. A few capabilites are as follows:

1. _Search Engine Optimization_

2. _Online Reputation Managment_

3. _Social Media Marketing_
